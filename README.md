# Data Structures Visualizer

## 📌 Introduction
The **Data Structures Visualizer** is an interactive web-based tool designed to help students and professionals understand the working of various data structures and algorithms through visual representation. This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

## 🎯 Features
- Interactive visualization of various data structures
- Step-by-step execution of algorithms
- Custom input for data structures
- Speed control for animations
- Code snippet and pseudocode display
- Dark mode for better readability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** C++ (for algorithm execution)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools:** WebSockets (for real-time updates), OpenStreetMap (if map-based visualization is needed)

## 📌 Supported Data Structures
### 🔹 Linear Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)

### 🔹 Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Red-Black, Heap)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Hash Tables

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js & npm
- PostgreSQL
- C++ Compiler

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datastructures-visualizer.git
   cd datastructures-visualizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the backend:
   - Ensure you have a running PostgreSQL database.
   - Compile the C++ algorithms:
     ```sh
     g++ -o algorithms algorithms.cpp
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📜 Usage
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
- Select a data structure.
- Provide custom input (if required).
- Start visualization and control animation speed.
